# Fitting

The act of contructing a curve of best fit involves finding a mathematical function which best describes the data generated in the lab.
We can use this function to infer about other values which we do not have data or we can use the parameters of the function itself as a measurement.

Always keep in mind that there is always a fitting cost in the form of uncertainty.
No fitting method is perfect and if you want to be rigorous, this need to be taken into account.
