# Data Manipulation

You have finished your lab session and you are left with a bunch of files with an endless stream of numbers.
The next port of call is to read that data into a program and start doing some real analysis.
This chapter will go through the tools and techniques needed to get your data into a situation where you can start to probe at the underlying physics.

This chapter requires you to be familiar with `pip` and how to install packages from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/).
The Python Software Foundation provides a [tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) on this topic.
You can ignore sections about virtual environments which will be touched on later in this book.
