# Plotting

Visualisation of data is the bread and butter of data analysis and science communication.

The most popular graphing package for Python and the one in which this book is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).
It is heavily integrated into other SciPy packages and allows for us to easily transform our Numpy array into images.
